<p>Did you know you don't have to go out to enjoy restaurant-worthy mozzarella sticks? Well, you don't! With this top-rated recipe, you can make irresistible fried mozzarella cheese sticks in the comfort of your own home.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1/4 cup water</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups Italian seasoned bread crumbs</li>
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>2/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/3 cup cornstarch</li>
    <li>2 cups oil for frying (or as needed)</li>
    <li>1 (450 grams) package mozzarella cheese sticks</li> 
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Whisk water and eggs together in a small bowl. Mix bread crumbs and garlic salt together in a medium bowl. Blend flour and cornstarch together in a third bowl.</li>
    <li>Heat oil to 185 degrees Celsius in a large, heavy saucepan</li>
    <li>Dredge a mozzarella stick in flour; shake off excess. Dip into egg mixture. Lift up so excess egg drips back in the bowl. Press into bread crumbs to coat. Place breaded mozzarella stick on a plate or wire rack. Repeat with remaining mozzarella sticks. Optional if you have the time, you could freeze the mozarella-sticks before frying. This will make the process a bit easier</li>
    <li>Use a spider spoon or a pair of tongs to lower 3 to 4 mozzarella sticks into the hot oil. Fry until golden brown, about 30 seconds. Remove from heat and drain on paper towels. Repeat to fry remaining mozzarella sticks.</li>
